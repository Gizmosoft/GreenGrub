# GreenGrub  

GreenGrub: Share recipes, shrink footprints! We calculate your dish's carbon footprint and guide you towards eco-friendly cooking. Let's savor sustainability together!  

### Inspiration  
Almost 30% of the global Green House Gases are emitted because of the food we eat. With the rising concern for preserving Earth and practicing sustainable methods, we feel making food sustainable is equally important.
### What it does?  
Foodies and cooking enthusiasts have been sharing their favorite food recipes on the internet for decades now. GreenGrub makes sharing recipes with the community more engaging and impactful by estimating the CO2 emission of the recipe and ranking recipes based on that.
### How we built it  
We built GreenGrub under 24hrs using MERN tech stack. Backend of the app was built using Node.js/Express.js, React.js was used for Frontend along with HTML, CSS, Boostrap and Material-UI. Authentication was handled using Google OAuth. MongoDB was used as a primary NoSQL database.
### Challenges we ran into  
Time was certainly a constraint, but we focused on developing only the key features to ship a finished product before the deadline. Estimating CO2 was bit difficult considering the shortage of data points being considered.
### Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We took the whole project from ideation to final product under 24 hours! Something we are really proud of...
### What we learned  
We learned the basics of creating a MVP under a short time. We also managed to learn how to develop key features in a timely manner. 
### What's next for GreenGrub  
- Enhance CO2 emission estimation by incorporating additional data points, such as emissions associated with various cooking methods
- Implement a recommendation system within the application to suggest alternate ingredients to further reduce carbon footprints
- Expand the application's scope by incorporating health benefits of recipes, benefiting both users and the environment
